# grants-template

Welcome to Project repository! This repository is for the submission of grants and the organization/voting of grant applications by the committee.

## Examples of what we fund
These are some examples of things the protocol would like to fund. This purpose of this wishlist is not to serve as an exhaustive list of everything that would be good for the protocol, but as a way to encourage ideas for potential applicants. If your idea to improve the protocol doesnâ€™t fit exactly, feel free to surprise us with your proposal!

## How to apply for a grant

1. Post an issue using the "Grant Application" issue template.
2. Join the #grants channel in our community Slack (click here to join).
3. Announce your grant application in the #grants channel and link back to the GitHub issue.

## Contribute to the fund
If you are interested in contributing monetarily to Project, visit [our Open Collective Portal](https://opencollective.com/opensource).

## How voting works
NOTE: Only committee members can vote on a proposal. Committee members are the following:

- Hudson Jameson (@Souptacular)
- Tommy Test (@test)

Grant applications will be numbered (G#) in the [Issues]() section and also displayed in the table below.

|  #  | Grant Name | Has there been a vote? | Voting Page | Accepted |
| --- |        ---        |       ---       |     ---     |    ---   |
| [G1](https://github.com/Souptacular/grants-template/issues/1)  |     [Video Demo](https://github.com/Souptacular/grants-template/issues/1)    |       No       |  [Click Here](https://github.com/Souptacular/grants-template/issues/2) |    No   |

Voting is done at the convenience of the comittee memebers and confirmed during recorded committee meetings. Voting is done in the issues labeled "G# - VOTING" and can be seen in the table above. Comittmee members can vote one of three ways:
- Thumbs up emoji to signal you want to approve the grant.
- Thumbs down emoji to signal you do not want to approve the grant.

The voting issue and the table above are updated to reflect the results of the vote (after being certified in the comittee meeting) and the issue is closed once a decision has been made.
